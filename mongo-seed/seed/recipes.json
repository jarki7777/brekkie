Let the mixture sit for at least a couple of days. Then remove the bananas and store in the refrigerator.","When making the pudding, be sure to whisk constantly, and make sure you get the edges, too. This helps prevent clumps and scorched pieces.","Use ripe bananas that aren't too ripe for both the best flavor and presentation.
